# Number Guessing Game

Computer selects a random number from the list and cross ref with user's guess

```python
import random

def fun(r1, r2):
     rando= random.randint(r1, r2)
     return rando

def game():
        print("Enter the lowest digit:")
        r1= int(input())
        print("Enter the highest digit:")
        r2= int(input())
        rando= fun(r1, r2)
        counter= 3
        done= 0

#print("Rando val for ref:", rando)

        while done< counter:
               done +=1
               print("Enter your Guess:")
               ans= int(input())

               if ans ==rando:
                      print("You guessed right")
                      break
     
               elif done>=counter and rando!= ans:
                      print("Better luck next time")

               elif ans< rando:
                      print("Your guess was too low, try again")

               elif ans > rando:
                      print("Your guess was Too high")

                #print("You have", counter-1, "turns left")            

        print("Do you wish to try again?")
        again= input()
        while again == 'Yes':
